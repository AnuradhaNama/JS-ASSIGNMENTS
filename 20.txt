20. How do you use React with TypeScript?

A. Using React with TypeScript provides strong typing for your React components and helps catch type-related errors during development. 
> how to use React with TypeScript:

1. Set Up Your Project
> Using Create React App:
> You can create a new React project with TypeScript using Create React App:
>> npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
> Using Vite:
> If you prefer Vite, you can set up a TypeScript project like this:
>> npm create vite@latest my-app --template react-ts

* Rename Files:
> Rename your .js or .jsx files to .ts or .tsx (for files that include JSX).

2. Basic TypeScript Usage with React:

* Functional Components:
Define the props type for functional components:
* Class Components:
Define the props and state types for class components:

1. Set Up: Use Create React App or Vite for a quick setup, or manually configure TypeScript.
2. Type Components: Define types for props and state in functional and class components.
3. Type Hooks: Use TypeScript with useState, useEffect, and other hooks.
4. Context: Define and use context with TypeScript for strong typing.
5. Event Handling: Specify event types for better type safety.
 * We can leverage TypeScript’s type-checking capabilities to improve the reliability and maintainability of your React applications.
