12. How do you fetch data from an API in a React component?

A. Fetching data from an API in a React component involves using JavaScript's fetch API (or other libraries like Axios) within the useEffect hook in functional components or within lifecycle methods in class components.
 Here's a detailed guide on how to do it:

* Using Functional Components with Hooks:
1. Fetching Data with 'fetch' and 'useEffect'.
The fetch API is a modern way to make HTTP requests. Combine it with useEffect to handle side effects in functional components.

2. Fetching Data with Axios and useEffect
Axios is a popular library for making HTTP requests and provides a simpler API compared to fetch.

* Key Points:
1. Handle Asynchronous Code: Use async/await inside the useEffect hook or lifecycle methods for handling asynchronous API requests.
2. Error Handling: Always include error handling to manage network issues or unexpected responses.
3. Loading State: Manage a loading state to inform users that data is being fetched.
4. Cleanup (if needed): If you set up subscriptions or other side effects, ensure you clean them up to prevent memory leaks.
By following these, you can effectively fetch and manage data in your React components.
