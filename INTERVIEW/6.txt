6. How do you pass props to a React component?

A. Passing props to a React component allows you to pass data from a parent component to a child component. 
This is one of the primary mechanisms for managing and sharing state and data in a React application.

* Steps to Pass Props to a React Component:
1. Define Props in Parent Component: When you render the child component in the parent component,
 you can pass data to the child component via attributes.
2. Access Props in Child Component: The child component can access the passed props via the props object.
* Passing Multiple Props:
You can pass multiple props to a component by adding more attributes.
* Using Destructuring:
You can use JavaScript destructuring to simplify access to props in the child component.
* Default Props:
You can define default values for props in case they are not provided by the parent component.
* Prop Types:
You can use the prop-types library to specify the expected types of props and whether they are required.
> By following these steps, you can effectively pass and manage props in your React components, 
allowing for flexible and reusable component design.
