2. How do you create a new React component?

A. Creating a new React component involves defining a JavaScript function or class that returns some JSX. 
Here's a basic guide to creating a new component:

1.Functional Component:
Functional components are the simplest way to write components in React. 
They are written as JavaScript functions.

2.Class Component:
Class components offer more features, such as state and lifecycle methods, but they are less common in modern React development due to the introduction of hooks.

* Using Hooks in Functional Components
With the introduction of hooks in React 16.8, functional components can now manage state and side effects.

* Steps to Create and Use a New Component:

1.Create a new file: Create a new file for your component, e.g., MyComponent.js.
2.Define the component: Write the component code as shown above.
3.Export the component: Ensure your component is exported using export default.
4.Import and use the component: In the file where you want to use your component, import it and include it in your JSX.
